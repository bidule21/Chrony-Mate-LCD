# Chrony-Mate-LCD
Historical repo for a PIC MCU based project for a remote LCD display for a Chrony F1 ballistic chronograph.
The Chrony F1 bullet chronograph has a serial data output for an accessory printer. 
I wrote this code to read the serial data and present shot statistics on a remote LCD (via a shielded cable).
My Chrony F1's internal LCD failed on me and I could not buy a new one, so this project was inspired...
